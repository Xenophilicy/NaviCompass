# NOTE: If you are using a URL, do NOT include the 'https://' or 'http://' in the link!
# If you don't want to use an image, simply don't add anything after your server port/world alias in the listing
# If you are using the INTERNAL transfer type, the world alias will be used in the transfer command
# You must also be sure that the world alias is EXACTLY the same as the world's folder name

# Add as many servers or worlds as you'd like:
# Add SERVERS using this format → ext:ServerTitle:ServerIP:ServerPort:ImageType:Path/URL
# Add WORLDS using this format → int:WorldTitle:WorldAlias:ImageType:Path/URL
